### Data Structures
#
# The state of the board is stored in a list. The list stores values for the board in the following positions:
#
# -------------
# | 3 | 7 | 6 |
# -------------
# | 5 | 1 | 2 |
# -------------
# | 4 | 0 | 8 |
# -------------
#
# The goal is defined as:
#
# -------------
# | 5 | 3 | 6 |
# -------------
# | 7 | 0 | 2 |
# -------------
# | 4 | 1 | 8 |
# -------------
#
# Where 0 denotes the blank tile or space.
